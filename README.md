### Example Code for an Image Factory in GCP - Red Hat v.8.X

### Summary

This is an example code of an Image Factory to create harenized and updated Red Hat 8 Images, with some other configurations following the company standards. 

### Considerations

- This is a work in progress, so the hardening was writen in Shell Scripting, but it is being migrated to Ansible. 
- The harening code is being also translated to English. 
- This example code creates two Images, one of them is just a standard Red Hat 8 and the other one is profiled with packages and specifications for SAS solution.
